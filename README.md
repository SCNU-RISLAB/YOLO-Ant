# YOLO-Ant: A Lightweight Detector via Depthwise Separable Convolutional and Large Kernel Design for Antenna Interference Source Detection

**Notes**: 

- The works we has use for reference including `YOLOv5s`（[code](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5)), `EdgeViTs`（[code](https://github.com/saic-fi/edgevit/tree/master)). Thanks for their wonderful works.
